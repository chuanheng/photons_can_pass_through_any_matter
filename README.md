# Photons can pass through any matter
A theory that photons can pass through any matter

### abstract
Modern physics generally believes that photons can only pass through a part of some matter.
This theory believes that photons can pass through any matter at the speed of light. When photons pass through matter, they will cause energy loss of photons. The magnitude of energy loss varies when passing through different matter, and the energy may even be reduced to infinitesimal, which is usually hidden in the cosmic microwave background radiation, so it is difficult for humans to detect it.
The reason why light is reflected when it passes through the surface of a matter is that the energy of the photon is transferred to the electrons on the surface of the matter, and then the electrons transfer the energy to the low-energy photons emitted from the opposite side, and the original photons have already passed through the matter.
The reason why light is refracted when it passes through the surface of a matter is that the energy of the photon is transferred to the electrons on the surface of the matter, and then the electrons transfer the energy to other low-energy photons, and the original photons have already passed through the matter.
This also explains why the speed of light propagation in matter is lower than the speed of light in a vacuum, because the photoelectric effect of the conversion of photoelectric energy takes a certain amount of time.
Blackbody radiation is the energy of electrons in matter that excites low-energy photons hidden in space.
This theory also boldly speculates that there are countless photons in any direction pointed by any spatial point in the universe.

### 摘要
现代物理学普遍认为光子只可以穿过某些物质。
本理论认为光子可以光速穿过任何物质，光子穿过物质时会导致光子的能量损耗，穿过不同的物质时能量损耗的大小不同，甚至能量降低到无穷小，通常被认为是宇宙微波背景辐射，难以被人类检测。
光穿过物质表面发生反射的原因是，光子的能量被传递给物质表面的电子，然后电子电子再把能量传递给对面射出的低能量光子，原来的光子已经穿过了物质。
光穿过物质表面发生折射的原因是，光子的能量被传递给物质表面的电子，然后电子再把能量传递给其它低能量光子，原来的光子已经穿过了物质。
这也解释了为什么光在物质中传播速度低于真空中的光速，因为光电能量的转换的光电效应需要消耗一定的时间。
黑体辐射是物质中的电子的能量激发了空间中隐藏的的低能量光子。
本理论还大胆的推测，宇宙中任意一个空间点指向的任意方向上都有无数个的光子。
